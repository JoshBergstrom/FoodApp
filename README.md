# Technical
## Models
I will be dealing with a few things first of which will be location so you don't see place's no where near you. The next will be type of food so that why you can get what you want and not just see random places. You'll also see info about each restaurant such as price, rating, and pictures of the store.
## Views
I will have about 4 views a search page, a page for swiping left or right on differnt restaurants. then you will be given a page showing what restaurant will be the best for you. There will also be a settings page that has accessibility settings for users who need them. 
## Controllers
I will have a controller for each page to manage everything going on on them.
